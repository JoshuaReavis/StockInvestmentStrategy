# StockInvestmentStrategy

This Java program uses a database of stock price data to determine an efficient trading mechanism.

Connnecting: This program uses a file named ConnectionParameters.txt as the default file for connection parameters. I have left the name of the database included in this file, but I have omitted the username and password details for security reasons.

I have written all programs within this project.
